title: "Airpods 2 vs AirPods Pro"
---

I have always been a massive Apple fanboy, owning many iterations of Macs, iPads, iPhones, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches. The one product that I have not owned since they came out were the AirPods, until now.

Recently I got the AirPods 2 and then shortly after I also got the AirPods Pro. I instantly fell in love with he AirPods 2. I have always really liked the earbuds that come with the iPhone. They have always seemed to fit my ears perfectly and I like that I am not totally disconnected to the outside world while using them. For me, the AirPods 2 were a perfect upgrade. I then purchased the AirPods Pro a few months later and honestly there are things that I love about them, but also there are some annoyances.

## Features of the AirPods 2

Looking first at the AirPods 2 the main features that have been touted time and time again is the ease of use, and I completely agree. **Setup takes a matter of seconds and then continued use is almost magical**. They are a perfect Apple product that follows the mantra that they just work.

I do have to say that there are times where I have to go in and manually change connect to the AirPods from my device, but that is mainly because I use them on my MacBook Pro, iPad, Apple TV, and iPhone. I am extremely excited for this fall when iOS 14 will enable the AirPods to switch automatically between devices. I will write a review of that functionality when it comes out.

Like I said before, I really like the feeling of wired Apple earbuds so these were a perfect extension, even feeling lighter since there is no cord that can possibly pull them down and out. For my ears I never felt like they were going to fall out. 

The audio quality is solid. I am no audiophile and am not looking for anything super fancy, but I really enjoy the sound quality of the AirPods. The case is a nice size that fits perfectly into my pocket. I also bought a silicone case that shows off my retro side and I find it much easier to open the case.

I honestly do not have any gripes about the AirPods 2. They are fantastic, simple devices that I now use daily. I wanted to try out the AirPods Pro and for me there are a couple of big differences.

## Features of the AirPods Pro

The AirPods Pro take the great things about the AirPods and add some more functionality. They are incredible devices and show off the complex simplicity of a great Apple product.

The first feature they added was the noice cancellation. I know there are other more expensive headphones and earbuds that have better noise cancellation, but the AirPods Pro still are fantastic. I can listen to music and feel almost completely isolated from the outside world.

For times that I do not want to be isolated, I can easily turn on transparency mode on the device that is playing music or just by pinching and holding the AirPods Pro stems. The feature uses the microphones to route in some audio and it works really well. I liked the original AirPods because I still can hear when someone is trying to get my attention and turning on transparency mode does just that. It is nice to have the option of total isolation or hearing some of what is going on.

I have heard many people say that they like the feeling of the AirPods Pro more than the original AirPods and surprisingly I actually like the feeling of the originals more. I have started getting used to the silicone tips of the Pros, but I definitely have more ear fatigue when I use them for a longer time. Personally it is because of the feeling of pressure from the seal mixed with the size. Silicone tips have never been my favorite types of earbud, but even with that in mind these are the most comfortable silicone earbuds that I have used. The pressure does seemed relieved slightly after you put them in which makes it better.

## Which Should You Buy?

So if you are looking for AirPods, which ones should you buy? There is not a straight answer of what I would suggest. If you like the feeling of the wired Apple earbuds and don’t need noise cancellation then I would just stick to the original AirPods. They are less expensive and I find them extremely comfortable. At times I would miss the noise cancellation, but for the price it is not a necessity. 

The AirPods Pro may be more comfortable if you don’t like the wired Apple earbuds. The noise cancellation is convenient at times and the sound quality is a little better, especially with the bass. I am excited to try out the spatial audio this fall also.

Overall the AirPods lineup that Apple has created and will continue to work on in the future is absolutely fantastic. They are so simple to connect and use and even though both of them have many pros and just a couple of cons they are definitely products that I would miss in my day to day life if I no longer had them.
